# ELLnotes

These notes were written during my time in National Junior College. They are based on lessons conducted by my teachers Mr Joel Poh, Mr Asraf Angullia, and Mr Chen Liangcai.

My teacher Mr Joel Poh actively maintains a repository for (in no way affiliated with this repository) his slides at [his repository here](https://github.com/jwnpoh/ELL-lessons).
