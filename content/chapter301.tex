    \section{Paper 2 Essay}
    
    \subsection{General Guidelines}
    Do these when attempting an essay question\footnote{There is no general formula to writing a paper 2 essay, these are just the essential things to consider---there is no one size fits all approach.}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Read the question carefully and identify the key word(s) that will reveal to you the \textbf{topic} to be discussed in the essay.
            \item Read the text and identify \textbf{examples} that are \textbf{significant} and \textbf{relate} to the theme of the question.
            \item \textbf{Analyse} the information in the text and \textbf{link} it to what you have learnt about language and society thus far.
        \end{enumerate}
        \exmp{Essay Planning}{Imagine you have a text that discusses the innovation of press printing which was introduced by Caxton, and the question asks you to talk about what this tells us about human nature and language. \par Here are some things worth discussing:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The invention of printing press allowed for texts and manuscripts to be mass produced, which led to increase in literacy and more interest in reading and writing.
            \item The spirit of innovation that people hae drive them to improve on current situations and become more efficient in solving problems.
            \item Today, this spirit is still strong as people are still looking for more efficient ways to communicate, from using their smartphones to using platforms like Skype, video calling, etc.
        \end{itemize}
        }

    \subsection{Structure}
    Expectations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continuous prose.
        \item PEEL structure where appropriate.
        \item Solid English.
        \item Bring in knowledge from Paper 1 where possible and appropriate.
        \item Bring in your own personal knowledge of language issues\footnote{It is better to present facts than personal anecdotes due to the nature of the discipline. Keep up-to-date with all domains as far as possible.}.
        \item Remember, it is a \textbf{sociolinguistics} paper.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Body Paragraphs}
        Number of points: try to come up with three overarching ideas. Intro, three body paragraphs, conclusion. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Possible overarching themes for essay organisation.
            \item Elements from Paper 1.
            \item Potential linguists/case studies to quote.
            \item Examples beyond the texts.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Feedback}
        \subsection*{T3W3 Timed Practice}
        [9727/02/O/N17] Discuss in detail the range of attitudes to Singapore Standard English and Singapore Colloquial English, and explore some of the reasons for these attitudes. \hfill [25]

        \subsubsection*{General Observations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Work quickly but accuracy should not be compromised.
            \item Many could not finish the essays/last few bits of essay were rushed.
            \item Missing components (eg no intro, no conclusion).
            \item Describing and narrating (regurgitation of) examples are not enough, does not show engagement with the question.
            \item Language: excercise caution with grammar.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection*{Task Analysis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unpack the attitudes people may have to the language varieties; note that there are usually two extremes: receptive vs reactionary.
            \item \textbf{Text B(i)} \begin{itemize}
                \item Identify SGEM as a move to try to clamp down SCE among Singaporeans.
                \item Discuss in the early years of introduction of SGEM, quote Lee Kuan Yew calling SCE as a ``handicap''.
                \item The more alert ones were able to identify that ``relentless'' (line 5) was quite strong, and rejustified the claim about these government efforts are allowances.
                \item Allowances in relation to how certain SCE sayings or utterances or lexis specific to SCE making appearances in texts, broadcasts, or mainstream media.
                \item ``[M]ajor obstacle... global competitiveness'' (line 6--7).
                \item Gupta referring to SCE as a `step-tongue' (line 9); implying some attitudes.
                \item Heavy utilisation of SCE (line 11), discuss on how SCE is commonly used in daily situations.
                \item Structurally, SCE is a vernacular.
                \item Discuss efficiency of language: SCE like Internet language have the appeal of using far fewer words to convey the same idea, and fewer worries for grammatical considerations such as verb inflections. 
                \item English education (lines 13--14): alternative proposal of some linguists: recognise that SCE exists, and teach the structures of both SSE and SCE so that students can differentiate between the two varieties. 
                \item Prestige/marker of identity/solidarity and rapport among Singaporeans/for informal and comfortable interactions with one another (lines 15-20).
                \item Diglossia in Singapore: with clear distinction between one variety and another, there will be very definied roles for each variety.
                \item Code/style switching: not everyone can code-switch easily (also in Text B(ii) line 12--13).
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Text B(ii)} \begin{itemize}
                \item Talking about being able to sell overseas vs making programmes being relatable to Singaporeans.
                \item Perciving language as a commodity vs using language for the establishment of solidarity.
                \item ``[L]ess sophisticated...'' (line 15) to describe SCE; representative of certain attitudes towards SCE
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
		
		\subsection*{T3 Block Timed Practice}
			\subsubsection*{Texts}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Text B(i)} \begin{itemize}
						\item Lines 21--26: note the choice of how CCS is written as the leader, where in the other direction of taking cues from Pereira could also be as valid. This is consistent with the androcentric nature of this text.
						\item ``Most fashionable females'' but there are quite a few pictures of men.
					\end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Text B(ii)} \begin{itemize}
						\item Difference in the gender discussed (vs Text B(i))
						\item Line 1: ``Top Five'' discusses the aesthetic value they bring across. The criteria used to evaluate the men seems to be quantifiable. Allude to how the communication of males (competititive) is this discourse.
						\item Lines 3--4: ``has also set some hearts throbbing and temperatures rising.'' Some kind of sexual undertone here? Temperature rising is quite literally a physiological response to seeing something attractive. Some kind of ``primal attraction'' toward these people.
						\item Most of the pictures in this text are solo portraits, but in Text B(i) are group photos. Perhaps discuss the air time allocated to women.
						\item Lines 9--10: ``crisp and sharp'': crisp like a freshly ironed shirt, sharp as in smart. ``even at the age of 40'': expectation that with age one might not be as sharp (though it might not be as significant).
						\item ``Poised for greater things in the party'' (line 11) ``serving... over a decade'' (line 13): credentials mentioned that are beyond the intended scope (at least according to the headline) of the article.
						\item ``brain and brawn'' (line 18): given a holistic representation of Lim as an individual (though how he has ``brawn'' is not mentioned).
						\item ``handled himself eloquently'' (line 16) description of his behaviour. 
						\item No MP track record but many mentions of how they have natural flair and assume these positions of leadership (perceptions and attitudes). In contrast to the women in Text B(i), there was no mention of their track records.
						\item ``SIA pilot'' (line 20) credentials mentioned again, not a bad job in the context in Singapore. 
						\item ``[D]abbled with his own business ventures'' (line 22) he could have failed? The connotation of ``dabbled'' is not positive (though that might not be the intention here).
						\item ``[S]wooped into the hearts and minds'' (line 21) weird choice of word. Significant in the sense that it is alluding to the attractiveness of the candidate. Interesting how ``minds'' are mentioned, when the scope of an article is about ``hunks''.
						\item ``Topless photos'' (line 28) alluding to the concept of sexual attraction. Though, this is one of the thing that is related to the ``hunk'' theme of the atricle's headline.
						\item Quite incoherent with the lack of a headshot of Chee in the article.
						\item ``[R]un triathlons'' (lines 31--32) discusses Chee's healthy hobby.
