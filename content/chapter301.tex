    \section{Paper 2 Essay}
    
    \subsection{General Guidelines}
    Do these when attempting an essay question\footnote{There is no general formula to writing a paper 2 essay, these are just the essential things to consider---there is no one size fits all approach.}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Read the question carefully and identify the key word(s) that will reveal to you the \textbf{topic} to be discussed in the essay.
            \item Read the text and identify \textbf{examples} that are \textbf{significant} and \textbf{relate} to the theme of the question.
            \item \textbf{Analyse} the information in the text and \textbf{link} it to what you have learnt about language and society thus far.
        \end{enumerate}
        \exmp{Essay Planning}{Imagine you have a text that discusses the innovation of press printing which was introduced by Caxton, and the question asks you to talk about what this tells us about human nature and language. \par Here are some things worth discussing:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The invention of printing press allowed for texts and manuscripts to be mass produced, which led to increase in literacy and more interest in reading and writing.
            \item The spirit of innovation that people hae drive them to improve on current situations and become more efficient in solving problems.
            \item Today, this spirit is still strong as people are still looking for more efficient ways to communicate, from using their smartphones to using platforms like Skype, video calling, etc.
        \end{itemize}
        }

    \subsection{Structure}
    Expectations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continuous prose.
        \item PEEL structure where appropriate.
        \item Solid English.
        \item Bring in knowledge from Paper 1 where possible and appropriate.
        \item Bring in your own personal knowledge of language issues\footnote{It is better to present facts than personal anecdotes due to the nature of the discipline. Keep up-to-date with all domains as far as possible.}.
        \item Remember, it is a \textbf{sociolinguistics} paper.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Body Paragraphs}
        Number of points: try to come up with three overarching ideas. Intro, three body paragraphs, conclusion. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Possible overarching themes for essay organisation.
            \item Elements from Paper 1.
            \item Potential linguists/case studies to quote.
            \item Examples beyond the texts.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Feedback}
        \subsection*{T3W3 Timed Practice}
        9727/02/O/N17
        Discuss in detail the range of attitudes to Singapore Standard English and Singapore Colloquial English, and explore some of the reasons for these attitudes. \hfill [25]

        \subsubsection*{General Observations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Work quickly but accuracy should not be compromised.
            \item Many could not finish the essays/last few bits of essay were rushed.
            \item Missing components (eg no intro, no conclusion).
            \item Describing and narrating (regurgitation of) examples are not enough, does not show engagement with the question.
            \item Language: excercise caution with grammar.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection*{Task Analysis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unpack the attitudes people may have to the language varieties; note that there are usually two extremes: receptive vs reactionary.
            \item \textbf{Text B(i)} \begin{itemize}
                \item Identify SGEM as a move to try to clamp down SCE among Singaporeans.
                \item Discuss in the early years of introduction of SGEM, quote Lee Kuan Yew calling SCE as a ``handicap''.
                \item The more alert ones were able to identify that ``relentless'' (line 5) was quite strong, and rejustified the claim about these government efforts are allowances.
                \item Allowances in relation to how certain SCE sayings or utterances or lexis specific to SCE making appearances in texts, broadcasts, or mainstream media.
                \item ``[M]ajor obstacle... global competitiveness'' (line 6--7).
                \item Gupta referring to SCE as a `step-tongue' (line 9); implying some attitudes.
                \item Heavy utilisation of SCE (line 11), discuss on how SCE is commonly used in daily situations.
                \item Structurally, SCE is a vernacular.
                \item Discuss efficiency of language: SCE like Internet language have the appeal of using far fewer words to convey the same idea, and fewer worries for grammatical considerations such as verb inflections. 
                \item English education (lines 13--14): alternative proposal of some linguists: recognise that SCE exists, and teach the structures of both SSE and SCE so that students can differentiate between the two varieties. 
                \item Prestige/marker of identity/solidarity and rapport among Singaporeans/for informal and comfortable interactions with one another (lines 15-20).
                \item Diglossia in Singapore: with clear distinction between one variety and another, there will be very definied roles for each variety.
                \item Code/style switching: not everyone can code-switch easily (also in Text B(ii) line 12--13).
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Text B(ii)} \begin{itemize}
                \item Talking about being able to sell overseas vs making programmes being relatable to Singaporeans.
                \item Perciving language as a commodity vs using language for the establishment of solidarity.
                \item ``[L]ess sophisticated...'' (line 15) to describe SCE; representative of certain attitudes towards SCE
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
